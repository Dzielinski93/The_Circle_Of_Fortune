# The Circle Of Fortune.

Hello ! My application is a simple game, all created in React. JS, which has very simple rules:

1. First, give your player name.
2. Then scroll and press the start button!
3. Start button will cause that, the circle with numerical values ​​visible in the middle of window will start to roll. On the wheel, there are numerical values ​​that are to point our future number of points in which we get when we give the good answer of the question, which will appear in the window.
4. The three hearts in the upper left corner of the window with the question, points the number of chances for the player, so if he answers the wrong question one of the hearts will disappear immediately.
5. In case, that all the players "lives" will disappear, the game ends.
6. If the "bankrupt" value is drawn, the player loses all points and the game also ends.
7. If you draw the "Loose a turn" value, the player must answer the drawn question, but he  doesn't receive points for it.
